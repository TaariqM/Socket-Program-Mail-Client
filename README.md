# Socket-Program-Mail-Client

 Simple mail client that sends e-mail to any recipient
 The client establishes a TCP connection with a Gmail server and creates dialogue using the SMTP protocol, sends an email message to a recipient through the mail server, and then closes the TCP connection with the mail server
 The code will ask you to enter the recipients email address along with the message that you want to send the recipient
 The code will then procede to output the communication with the client server and the recipients mail server
